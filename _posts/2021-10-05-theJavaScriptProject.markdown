I have been neck deep in JavaScript content for what feels like so long now, that I have crow's feet I don't recognize. Grabbing as much information as my mind would allow, I stacked the e-books and kept my printer warm for stocking binders with treasured writings. Collecting so many resources was almost unmanageable, and at times, confusing, because I couldn't remember where I got what bit where. Here I am, again, but now I'm taking notes of my notes. There's truly too much to remember!

Digging through annotated snippets becomes the norm.

Using my own notes becomes a skillset.

Notebooks become treasure boxes of handy tools and tips and tricks.
