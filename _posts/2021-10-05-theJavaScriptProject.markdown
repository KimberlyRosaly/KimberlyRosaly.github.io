*I have been neck deep in JavaScript content for what feels like so long now, that I have crow's feet I don't recognize. Grabbing as much information as my mind would allow, I stacked the e-books and kept my printer warm for stocking binders with treasured writings. Collecting so many resources was almost unmanageable, and at times, confusing, because I couldn't remember where I got what bit where. Here I am, again, but now I'm taking notes of my notes. There's truly too much to remember!*

  <h3>
    Digging through annotated snippets becomes the norm.
    <br>
    Using my own notes becomes a skillset.
    <br>
    Notebooks become treasure boxes of handy tools and tips and tricks.

*I see boxes inside boxes. I look at HTML and it's just trees of data.. 
<br>
a different kind of tree-of-knowledge. 
<br>
Containers that contain containers containing containers. Deciphering this, for me, required me to physically build out the familiarity of these patterns in my mind.. find the nodes, cut away all the syntax and sit with the meat. Travel with the data as it flows from one function to another, one method to another.*
