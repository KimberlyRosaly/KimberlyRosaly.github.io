          PROJECT BITS : RESTful routes, CRUD actions, SQLite3, ActiveRecord, Sinatra | BCrypt, Corneal

            THE HUMAN SiDE OF CODING
            HOW TO GET THROUGH THE PROJECT MINUS THE MENTAL BREAKDOWN
    CHEATSHEET
    -gather as many varied resources that make sense to you as possible
    -read as much about the topic as you can (when something doesn't make sense)
    -practice making scrappy projects - AKA the failure pile
    -reach out to code buddies AND the pros for the code AND your mental health
    -pay attention to your physical health - drink water, eat nutritious food, sleep


After attempting this project many, *many* times..I feel excited to have finally made it - out alive and on the other side!

There were countless sessions of frustrated groaning through errors and feigning through backtraces for what I did wrong. Many sleepless nights and days of forgetting to eat or even just to look away from the screen. I was tired and feeling hopeless that I wasn't smart enough or good enough to complete the project. I couldn't understand why things weren't as fluid for me as they appeared to be for other programmers or why I couldn't seem to make any real progress after long bouts of time. However, I was determined to debug my brain and find the solution as to why things weren't working for me the way I thought they should. I pulled away from my normal ways of thinking to open up to new ideas on how to live life as a coder. I couldn't apply my regular day-to-day 'work hard, loner' logic anymore. It wasn't working. I was making myself sick. I had to make changes.

After reaching out to peers and professionals for guidance..eventually I was able to see patterns more clearly and understand the lines of code logic that we're meant to be striving to create in the first place. The more I read about concepts, and the more applications I looked at, the more things started to make sense and snap into place. Seeing different stylings of code rocking around the same core patterns made it solidify in my mind.

Cue "healing."

Repetition seemed to be an answer for me - to see the forest for the trees. Exposure made me so much more comfortable and eventually I was able to create applications that actually worked, that actually made sense, that actually served its purpose. Anxiety fled when I could finally see how other humans made their code work and how truly unified we really truly are going through this process. Yeah, it's true: we're *all* groaning through error messages.

I find when I take a step back from the binary to find the connections, that I really do my best work.

Creating new projects, successes coupled with failings, only served to teach me even more. Each "mind-blowing" fail that I follied and sobbed through, forced me to find my way back to the surface, identify which parts were "broken," and logically try to break down a solution. My future successful projects, many-a-times, I'd hit a similar "break" and hit my 'aha!' moment with the memory of how I fixed it in the past. Suddenly, I wasn't really making the same mistakes anymore, but the best part of that was how much it made sense. 

Finally, code was making sense.

EXAMPLE EXPLANATION

Here, you can see a part of my planning process. I tried to visualize what I wanted my application to look like and how those model associations and relationships could work. Planning things out visually tends to give me a leg up into the next stage of progress. Though my visualizations may not line up perfectly with the final application, or may even be tossed completely, it gives a clear direction of goals for planning and moving code forward. Inspiration can come at any time and change ideas and implementations. Embrace the mistakes and embrace change; an empowering way to learn.

CONCLUSION

I really felt that this project was more about me reevaluating how I feel towards failure than creating lines of code.

Understanding my errors motivates me to move forward, repair my mistakes along the way, and eventually discover the path to where I really want to go. Not to mention how much more evolved I've become throughout this process of finding myself..

..and my applications.
