Blog Assigned Topic: Talk about coding in general. Have you found any commonalities between code and other aspects of your life?



It's always right in your face.
Right under your nose.

It eludes you even though it's right in front of you and genuinely within your reach.

The solution is always simpler than I think.

I just need to turn down the sound of all the grinding of all those noisy gears and see the problem for what it really is. Strip away the convoluded complexities and see the base parts as they truly exist. Shut off the fear. Turn off the self-talk. Observe. Without bias. And it all becomes so simple. So straight-forward. So simple.

God explicitly tells us that the answer to all of life's questions is ... love..
and if you really search through your life and focus on the relationships (with others, with yourself, with the physical world, with the meta..etc.) you'll find that He was right, of course. 
The answer really is always going to be love.
To me, this concept serves as a paralell, a reminder: the solution is always simpler than it appears to our weak minds and faltering flesh.

If God's answer is simple.. and He is the God of everything..
then our solutions are also simple.. as we stand as the gods of machine.

We should strive to be like God.
We should strive to be simple.
