INTRO
javascript mastery comes in time
learning new things is forever
learning react is no different - absorb SYNTAX and FUNCTIONS, CONVENTIONS and DESIGN PATTERNS

MAIN
React makes sense by following convention
React revolves around components and resuability
making code more modular and fun to play with 
because it keeps bugs encapsulated with ease
to me, it feels like frictionless slots on a motherboard
it all comes together and makes up one big giant app of data and behaviors
children hinge off their parents, siblings present similarly appearing data 


CONCLUSION
with the right tools at your disposal
patience with documentation
a willingness to explore playfully
it's amazing to have limitless libraries that do seemingly impossible, complicated things, within reach. 

Languages are fun to learn and learning how to have fun with them becomes a necessary language all its own.
